   * When a Couchbase Server node fails over, documents on the failing node
   * that haven't been fully replicated may be "rolled back" to a previous state.
   * To ensure consistency between Couchbase and the Kafka topic, the connector
   * can defer publishing a document to Kafka until it has been saved to disk
   * on all replicas.
   * <p>
   * To enable this feature, specify a non-zero persistence polling interval.
   * The interval is how frequently the connector asks each Couchbase node
   * which changes have been fully replicated and persisted. This ensures
   * consistency between Couchbase and Kafka, at the cost of additional latency
   * and bandwidth usage.
   * <p>
   * To disable this feature, specify a zero duration (`0`). In this mode the
   * connector publishes changes to Kafka immediately, without waiting for
   * replication. This is fast and uses less network bandwidth, but can result
   * in publishing "phantom changes" that donâ€™t reflect the actual state of
   * a document in Couchbase after a failover.
   * <p>
   * TIP: Documents written to Couchbase with enhanced durability are never
   * published to Kafka until the durability requirements are met, regardless
   * of whether persistence polling is enabled.
   * <p>
   * CAUTION: When connecting to an ephemeral bucket, always disable
   * persistence polling by setting this config option to `0`,
   * otherwise the connector will never publish any changes.
